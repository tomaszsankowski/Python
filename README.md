# Python Projects Archive

Welcome to my archive of projects written in Python!

This repository serves as a collection of old, smaller projects that I completed during my studies and as part of my personal interests. Here you will find various algorithm implementations, machine learning models, simulations, and data analyses.

## Repository Contents

Below is a list of projects included in this archive:

* **[lab1-linear-regression](./lab1-linear-regression)** - Implementation of the linear regression algorithm.
* **[lab2-genetic-algorithms](./lab2-genetic-algorithms)** - Genetic algorithms (Knapsack problem).
* **[lab3-minmax](./lab3-minmax)** - MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning (Connect 4 game).
* **[lab4-classification](./lab4-classification)** - Classification (Decision Trees, Random Forests).
* **[lab5-clustering](./lab5-clustering)** - Clustering (K-Means algorithm).
* **[lab6-neural-networks](./lab6-neural-networks)** - Neural networks (implementation in NumPy and PyTorch).
* **[lab7-reinforcement-learning](./lab7-reinforcement-learning)** - Reinforcement learning (Q-Learning, Frozen Lake).
* **[proj1-macd-stock-index](./proj1-macd-stock-index)** - Analysis of the MACD stock market indicator.
* **[proj3-interpolation](./proj3-interpolation)** - Polynomial interpolation methods.
* **[python-oop-simulation](./python-oop-simulation)** - Virtual world simulation based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Each directory contains its own README.md file with a detailed description of the given project.
