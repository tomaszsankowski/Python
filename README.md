- **[lab4-classification](./lab4-classification)**: Classification tasks using Decision Trees and Random Forests.
- **[lab5-clustering](./lab5-clustering)**: Unsupervised learning demonstrating the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- **[lab6-neural-networks](./lab6-neural-networks)**: Neural network implementations using both low-level NumPy and high-level PyTorch.

### 🧠 Intelligent Algorithms & Games

- **[lab2-genetic-algorithms](./lab2-genetic-algorithms)**: Solving the classic Knapsack problem using genetic algorithms.
- **[lab3-minmax](./lab3-minmax)**: Implementation of the MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for a Connect 4 game engine.
- **[lab7-reinforcement-learning](./lab7-reinforcement-learning)**: Reinforcement learning experiments (Q-Learning) using the Frozen Lake environment.

### 📊 Data Science & Mathematics

- **[proj1-macd-stock-index](./proj1-macd-stock-index)**: Financial data analysis focused on the MACD stock market indicator.
- **[proj3-interpolation](./proj3-interpolation)**: Comparison and implementation of various polynomial interpolation methods.

### 🐍 Simulations & OOP

- **[python-oop-simulation](./python-oop-simulation)**: A Virtual World simulation that emphasizes clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design in Python.

## Setup and Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher is recommended.
- **Virtual Environment**: It is highly recommended to use `venv` or `conda` to manage dependencies.
- **Core Libraries**: Most projects rely on `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `PyTorch` (for NN/RL labs).

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project of your choice.
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (if a requirements.txt is present):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
