| [**proj3-interpolation**](./proj3-interpolation) | Implementation and comparison of various polynomial interpolation methods. |
| [**python-oop-simulation**](./python-oop-simulation) | A comprehensive Virtual World simulation emphasizing clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design. |

## Setup and Requirements

- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher is recommended.
- **Environment:** It is highly recommended to use `venv` or `conda` to manage dependencies.
- **Core Libraries:** Most projects rely on `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `PyTorch`.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the specific project directory.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (if a requirements.txt is present):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
